|Description:                                                                                                |
|- Our team have developed a 2D simulation application of the universe that you can create your own galaxy   |
|with planets and satellites. By applying the effect of the attraction force, your universe will move        |
|automatically.                                                                                              |
|- In this project, we have used the library "tkinter" of python because it's included in Python packages    |
|so you don't need to install. Moreover, tkinter has all tools that we need so that we don't need another one|
|- We have faced a lot of difficult in solving the conflict between the default behavior and the personalized|
|one, as well as the threads of the application because tkinter don't let us touch the main loop.            |
|- In the future, we want to have a timer for our space and we want to add more physic effect to make it more|
|realistic.                                                                                                  |

|Installation:                                                                                               |
|- This application requires the Python language so you need to go to https://www.python.org/ to download it.|
|- After downloading the application, open the terminal in this file the type the command "python main.py"   |
|and you are ready to explore the space.                                                                     |

|- Once you open the application, you will get a screen like in start_screen.png. You will have a black      |
|screen with a menu in the top and in the left. At the top left of the screen is a switch-mode button. The   |
|eye in the button show that you are in the view mode in which your universe will move.                      |
|- If you click on that button you will change your application to configuration mode like in config_mode.png|
|This time that button change to a config sign and a menu will show up. In this mode your universe will stop |
|moving. On the menu on the left you will see 3 buttons with 3 functions.                                    |
|- The create button will help you create your planets. On clicking it, a small window will show up and you  |
|have to fill the information of the planet and then click ok. If you don't want to continue you can click   |
|cancel.                                                                                                     |
|- After creating your first planet, you will see a button showing up on the menu on the top. This is where  |
|you can check all your planet. By clicking these button, you will move to the corresponding planet.
|- The delete button will help you remove the unwanted planet by clicking on that planet.                    |
|- The save button will save your galaxy for the next time.                                                  |
|- You can move around in your universe by dragging and dropping the mouse or pressing UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT key|
